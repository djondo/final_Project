   /* -Create following classes: Animals (stores all animal common characteristics)
   , and subclasses (WildAnimals & Pets) --- each type of animal characteristics will be stored here
   - create classes (PetGroup and WildAnimalGroup) --- after entering all animals data
   regardless of their traits resemblance, put them then into these classes,
   so that when Pets will be assembled in Pets group and Wild animals in WildAnimalGroup
   Main class: useful to manage all classes and run the program

   tasks: sort animals in alphabetical order/ search for a given animal/
   after entering and storing animals in their respective groups,
    now ask program or system where (PetGroup or WildAnimalGroup)
     they belong to and the system should be able to do so


   Insert GUI features --- provoking(?) animal sounds and pictures could be greater
    when checking an animal name in the JPanel
   Save program into a database
   Possible some adding JTable(s)
